# ðŸ§  Quantum Teleportation with Qiskit

This project implements and visualizes the **quantum teleportation protocol** using [Qiskit](https://qiskit.org/).  
Quantum teleportation allows the transfer of an **unknown qubit state** from one location (Alice) to another (Bob) using **entanglement** and **classical communication** â€” without physically moving the qubit itself.

## ðŸš€ Overview

In this notebook, I simulate the full teleportation process step-by-step:

1. **State Preparation** â€“ Create an arbitrary qubit state (the one we want to teleport).  
2. **Entanglement Generation** â€“ Use a Hadamard and CNOT gate to entangle two qubits between Alice and Bob.  
3. **Bell Measurement** â€“ Alice performs quantum operations and measurements on her qubits.  
4. **Classical Communication** â€“ Alice sends her two measurement results to Bob.  
5. **Reconstruction** â€“ Bob applies conditional gates (X and Z) to recover the original state.  
6. **Verification** â€“ Compare Bloch spheres and statevectors to confirm teleportation fidelity.
